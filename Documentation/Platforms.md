## Platforms

This library aims to offer support for multiple platforms through a single codebase. This is highly ambitious, so if you run into an issue with your platform of choice during development, please leave a detailed bug report with as much information as possible. Also, as this library is relatively new, mobile platforms will be fully supported after all other platforms are complete.
